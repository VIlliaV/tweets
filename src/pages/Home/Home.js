        and captivating thoughts. Our application offers you a unique
        opportunity to stay updated on the latest news, trends, and opinions
        from your favorite authors. On the homepage, you will be greeted by
        cards featuring user avatars and the number of tweets they have. You can
        keep track of their activity and show your interest by becoming a
        follower of a chosen user. By clicking the "Follow" button, you
        subscribe to updates from that user and receive their new tweets in your

        you can always click the "following" button and stop receiving updates
        from that user. We invite you to join our vibrant community, interact
        with authors, discuss, and share your thoughts. Discover new things,
        broaden your perspectives, and expand your world of tweets with us.
